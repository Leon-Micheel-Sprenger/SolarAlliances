It is the year of 2350. Humankind has evolved and expanded its habitat across the solar system. The formation of new political systems in the system creates a call for new leaders, who must carry the responsibility of an entire civilization on their shoulders. Will you be one of those leaders?

**Solar Alliances** is an Online Multiplayer Resource Management Game. 
As the commander of a space station in one of three factions, the player has to gather resources by accepting Singleplayer and Multiplayer missions. In order to venture on these missions, the player needs to build space ships ships and eventually upgrade his/her spacestation.

*Note that this project is only the vertical slice of what is supposed to be the full version of the game. Hence, only one faction can be choosed by the Player: Mars*

## Background
This Game was a university project at IADE Creative University in Lisbon. 
The objective was to create a Node.js Web Application, that is running in the browser. Additionally, the **p5.js library** was supposed to be used to create a 2D online Multiplayer Browser Game.
In the creation of the game we drew inspiration from the TV show **The Expanse** which also plays in a sci-fi future, in which humanity has populated the solar system. 

**Feel free to play the game and give us feedback on how you like it.** It's not perfect, but it sure was a lot of fun doing this project.
